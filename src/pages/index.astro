    <p><strong>I was terrified of JavaScript.</strong></p>
    <p>When Prof. Teeters first mentioned I'd be learning to code, I imagined walls of
    cryptic symbols and error messages that made no sense. I thought programming was
    only for people who already understood it—a circular trap I couldn't escape.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">But then Prof. Teeters handed me a simple task: build my own Robot ID Card.
    One small piece at a time. And suddenly, JavaScript wasn't a monster—it was just
    a language, like any other, waiting to be learned.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Come see how I figured it out. I made plenty of mistakes along the way,
    and I'll share every one of them with you. 🟠</p>

                    <h3>🔬 What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>The building blocks of JavaScript: variables, data types, and operators.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">By the end, I could store information, check its type, and make calculations—all the basics for real programs.</p>

                    <h3>🎯 How I Practiced</h3>
                    <p>I built my own Robot ID Card, piece by piece.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Each station added something new to the card, so I could see my code actually <em>doing</em> something.</p>

                    <h3>🎨 My Philosophy</h3>
                    <p>Mistakes are data, not failures.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters says the fastest way to learn is to break things, understand why they broke, and fix them.</p>

                    <h3>🤔 My Advice</h3>
                    <p>Don't try to memorize everything at once.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1">Focus on understanding <em>why</em> code works. The syntax will stick once the concepts click.</p>
