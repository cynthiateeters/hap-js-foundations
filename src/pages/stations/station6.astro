    <p><strong>Welcome to Station 6!</strong> I wondered—if AI can write code, why am I learning
    this at all? I could ask it to build my whole Robot ID Card!</p>
    <p class="mt-1">So I tried it. I asked an AI to "fix my code" without understanding what was wrong.
    It fixed it. Beautiful! I shipped it. But the next time I hit a similar problem, I was just as lost.
    I hadn't learned anything—I'd just outsourced thinking.</p>
    <p class="mt-1">Prof. Teeters sat me down. "HAP, AI is a study partner, not a substitute for your brain.
    Use it to <em>understand</em>, not to avoid understanding. Ask it 'why does this work?'
    not just 'make this work.'"</p>

    not a crutch... 🟠</p>

This code works:

Can you explain WHY const behaves differently from let?
I want to understand the concept, not just memorize the rule.`;
